Javascript
=================
- Programming language
- to perform logical operations and provide behaviour
- To execute Javascript we need a runtime 
- Node js is used to provide this runtime environment
- Runtime environment includes javascript engine, it compiles the code and execute it.
- Runtime is built in with the web browser(V8 for chrome, spider monkey for mozilla).
- Nodejs also uses V8 javascript engine.



node -v to check the node version.

If you don't see version download the nodejs lts package from the website
and install it.


Data Types
===========

1. Primitive data Types:
 -String
 -number
 -boolean
 -undefined - variable declared but no value assigned
 -null - no value at all
2. Reference Types:
 -Object: js Object
          array

** Javascript is a dynamically typed language: we don't have to specify the 
datatype of the value that we need to store. Javascript will automatically recognize and assign the type.

** var keyword is used to create a variable.

Basic Commands
----------------
1. console.log() - to print output in terminal
2. var - to declare a variable to hold a value
3. typeof() - return the datatype of the specific variable/value

Template Literals
-----------------
- Used to append dynamic data with String
    syntax: `${variable}`

Operators
============

Assignment operator
-------------------
= to assign values from right to left
    eg: var num = 5;

Arithematic Operators
---------------------
+,-,*,/,% 

Comparison Operators
--------------------
== and === 
== only checks the value
=== checks the value and datatype

>
<
>=
<=
!= value only
!== type and value

Logical Operators
-----------------
&&
||
!

Increment and decrement operator
--------------------------------
++
--

String concatenation
--------------------
+ is used for string concatenation






Javascript Objects
====================
incomplete
----------


Object.seal()
-----------
This method is used to control the mutability of the object. 
- It prevent adding new properties or removing existing properties. 
- It allows modification for values of existing properties.
- It will not throw error when we try to add new properties.

Object.freeze()
---------------
This is also used to control the mutability of the object
- It prevents adding, removing and modifying the properties.
- This also doesnot throw any error.

Array of Objects
=================
Each element in an array is an object.

eg:- var student=[
    {name:"john",branch:"cse"},
    {name:"doe",branch:"ece"}
]
