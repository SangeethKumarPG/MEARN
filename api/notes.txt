API

- Application Programming Interface.
Mechanism that enable front-end and backend to communicate with each other.
It can also be used for connecting the backend with any other application.
API's must follow a set of rules

Two types of API
----------------

2) Private API's: Internal to a company or organisation. We cannot use it directly. We need to use authentication tokens to access them.

access the information.

Authentication is done through username and password.
Authorization is implemented through roles and usergroups.
