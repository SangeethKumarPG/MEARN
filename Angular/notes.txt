Angular
=======
Front end technology used to create the UI. 
- First version of angular angular js.
- Version 2 uses Angular with typescript.
- typescript is a superset of javascript. It uses all the methods and properties of javascript along with
data type declaration.
- Used to create single page application(index.html), we load the components into this page.
- It is a framework unlike react. 
- We have separate file for html, css and typescript for a component.
- We use commands to create a component. When you create a component, associated html, css, ts and a
spec file is created. The spec file is used for unit testing. 
- Angular is maintained by google.
- angular application and all it's components can be created using angular-cli
- To install angular we use npm install -g @angular/cli@version
- The most commonly used version is 16
- to check if angular is installed we use
    ng v
- to create a new application 
    ng new <project-name>

- to run the project we navigate to the project directory and can use 
    ng serve -o (automatically opens the browser)
    or 
    npm start

Files and folder structure of Angular project
----------------------------------------------
.gitignore : files and folders to be ignored by git
.editorConfig : configuration for code editor
angular.json : angular project configuration file. Contains information about the project such as project name,
version, scripts, styles, and other details.
readme.md : description of the project
tsconfig.json : typescript configuration file.
node_modules : contains all the depenedencies of the project.
package.json : It include scripts, packages installed, dev dependencies etc.
package-lock.json : detailed description of package.json.
src folder : It includes components, assets, main.ts, index.html, style.css
            index.html : Only html file that renders.
            app : Base component of the application.
            style.css : Global css file for the application.
            main.ts : Entry point to the main typescript file. entry point to the application.

While creating a component 4 files will be created.
1. component.html
2. component.css
3. component.ts
4. component.spec.ts

To create a component we use the command:
ng generate component <component-name>
or 
ng g c <component-name>

inside the component-name.component.ts file we will see the selector of the component,
we can place selector as a tag and use with other components.

Data Binding
============
1. one way data binding:
    a. ts file to html file(view)
        {{}} - string interpolation, to pass data from ts to html.
        [attribute] = value, called property binding. 
            eg:<img [src] = "imagePath"/>
    b. event binding : from html file to css file 
        syntax : (event)="method"
        eg: <button (click)="showName()">SHOW</button> 
            in the ts file we can define showName() method inside the component class. like:
            showName(){
                alert("Hello");
            }
        we can also pass arguments to the functions like:
        <button (click)="showName(7)">SHOW</button> 
        in the ts class of the component
         showName(count:number){
            alert("Hello"+" "+count);
        }
        note that we need to decalare the type of the arguments.
        To define undefined to the string we can use
        variable:string|undefined;

        if we have an array 
        variable : string[] = []
        to initialize an empty string array.

        We can use "any" type to declare a variable of any type.
        

2. two way data binding:
