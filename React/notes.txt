React JS
---------
Front-end technology used to create User Interface. 
It is a javascript library. It make use of multiple javascript libraries to create front-end.
libraries - predefined code to do a particular task.
Framework - set of libraries. Prebuilt set of tools libraries and conventions that provide a structured way to
            develop a software application.

Features of React
-----------------
- Used to create front-end 
- SPA (Single Page Application): It is a web application that  provide a seamless, dynamic user experience without the need to reload the entire,
    page from the server. In react we only have one html file called index.html file inside public folder. Browser only loads this html page, 
    while the user requests other webpages, only the content inside this index.html page reloads.

    In traditional web-application we have multiple html pages. for each iteration, the application typically loads a new page from the server
    resulting in full page refresh.

- React uses virtual DOM. 
    Real DOM - the actual representation of the webpage that browser renders.
    Virtual DOM - Lightweight representation of the real dom. 

    How react uses virtual DOM? 
        While a react application loads/starts, initially it create Real DOM along with Virtual DOM. 
        If any events happend and changes the html element, it creates a new virtual dom, then compares the newly created virtual dom with,
        previous one and finds the difference. Then react updates only the changed html elements based on the identified differences.

    Diffing: Process of compairing new virtual dom with the previous virtual dom to find the difference.
    Reconcillation: After diffing react update the real dom with only the changes. 

- React js is fully component based. 
- Data sharing is uni-directional(from parent to child component).
- Language used is JSX (combination of html css and js). File extensions for components we are generally using (.jsx).
- transpiling : process of converting jsx into javascript, css and html. babel is a compiler that performs the transpiling.
